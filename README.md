# Sipply — Your Daily AI Intelligence Briefing

> **Sip** your morning news. **Supply** yourself with signal, not noise.

**Problem:** AI professionals lose hours daily sifting 10+ publications to find decision-relevant signal.

**Solution:** A production pipeline that ingests, scores, clusters, and summarises AI news into a role-personalised daily brief — automatically, bilingually, at under $1/day.

- Replaced LLM-based scoring with a trained TF-IDF + Ridge model (422 GPT-labelled examples, Pearson r=0.75), cutting per-run inference cost to $0 while covering 44% of the relevance signal — enabling the system to scale to any volume without API cost growth
- Shipped a complete 10-stage production pipeline (ingest → filter → ML score → cluster → cross-day dedup → summarise → translate) running 4×/day on Railway with Redis caching and automatic failover, serving real users a bilingual EN/ZH digest with zero manual intervention
- Fine-tuned Qwen2.5-1.5B via LoRA on 780 knowledge-distilled GPT-4o-mini examples (ROUGE-L = 0.37), validating a path to eliminate LLM API dependency entirely at production scale

**Live demo:** [sipply.dev](https://sipply.dev)

## Why I built this

The AI space moves faster than any newsletter can keep up with. I wanted a tool that:
- **Aggregates** every major AI publication automatically
- **Filters** noise from signal with a fast rule-based gate, then ranks by a trained ML scorer
- **Clusters** related stories so you see the thread, not just individual articles
- **Personalises** the angle depending on whether you're a PM, engineer, or student
- **Translates** everything to Chinese for bilingual readers

So I built it — including the ingestion pipeline, the ML scoring model, the LLM processing chain, the REST API, and the frontend.

```

The backend is **stateless**. All state lives in PostgreSQL. Redis caches hot endpoints (5-min TTL) and is busted after each successful pipeline run.

## Pipeline stages

Each stage is a standalone script; `run_pipeline.py` orchestrates them in sequence.

| # | Stage | Script | What it does |
|---|-------|--------|-------------|
| 1 | **Ingest** | `ingest_full_articles` | Fetches full HTML; deduplicates by URL; incremental via HTTP ETag + poll-frequency gate |
| 2 | **Filter** | `filter_articles` | Rule-based gate: rejects short/off-topic/duplicate articles via regex + content hash (zero LLM cost) |
| 3 | **Score** | `score_articles` | Composite signal score: rule-based dims (recency, source authority, content richness) + ML model for audience fit / practical relevance / novelty |
| 4 | **Cluster** | `cluster_articles` | TF-IDF vectorisation → cosine similarity → greedy merge into story clusters |
| 5 | **Status** | `update_cluster_status` | Labels clusters: `new` / `escalating` / `peaking` / `ongoing` / `fading` |
| 6 | **Dedup** | `dedup_clusters` | Title-similarity merge across days so recurring stories accumulate evidence |
| 7 | **Summarise** | `summarize` | GPT-4o-mini writes summary, 3 takeaways, and PM / dev / student audience blocks |
| 8 | **Translate clusters** | `translate_clusters` | Translates all cluster text fields to Chinese |
| 9 | **Draft** | `generate_draft` | GPT-4o-mini writes a LinkedIn newsletter draft for the highest-scoring cluster |
| 10 | **Translate drafts** | `translate_drafts` | Translates all draft fields to Chinese |

## ML scoring model

Three dimensions of the signal score were previously hardcoded at 3.0. They are now predicted by a trained TF-IDF + Ridge Regression model, covering **44% of total score weight**.

### Training pipeline

```
422 articles (production DB)
    → GPT-4o-mini labels audience_fit / practical_relevance / novelty (1-5)
    → TF-IDF (unigrams + bigrams, 30k features) + Ridge Regression
    → 5-fold cross-validation
    → models/scorer.pkl
```

### Evaluation (5-fold CV on 422 labeled examples)

| Dimension | Pearson r | MAE | vs. mean baseline |
|-----------|-----------|-----|-------------------|
| audience_fit | 0.75 | 0.71 | +40% |
| practical_relevance | 0.69 | 0.73 | +32% |
| novelty | 0.71 | 0.62 | +36% |

### Inference

Inference runs in ~1ms locally (vs ~1s for an LLM call) at zero marginal cost. Falls back to `3.0` defaults if `models/scorer.pkl` is not present, so deploys are always safe.

### Retrain

```bash
# 1. Re-label articles (run from backend/)
python -m scripts.label_for_training --output data/labels.jsonl --limit 600

# 2. Retrain and evaluate
python -m scripts.train_scorer --labels data/labels.jsonl --output models/scorer.pkl
```

## LLM fine-tune (Qwen2.5-1.5B + LoRA)

A Qwen2.5-1.5B-Instruct model fine-tuned on Sipply's summarization task as an experimental alternative to GPT-4o-mini for article and cluster summarization.

### Training

```
780 examples (422 article + 358 cluster summarization pairs)
    → GPT-4o-mini outputs used as training labels
    → LoRA fine-tune (r=16) on Google Colab T4 GPU (free tier)
    → ~56 minutes training time, 2 epochs
    → models/qwen-adapter/
```

### Results

| Metric | Score |
|--------|-------|
| ROUGE-1 | 0.505 |
| ROUGE-2 | 0.227 |
| ROUGE-L | 0.366 |

Evaluated on 156 held-out examples against GPT-4o-mini outputs as reference.

### Retrain

```bash
# Export training data from DB
python -m scripts.export_finetune_data --output-dir data/

# Run finetune_qwen.ipynb in Google Colab (T4 GPU, free tier)
# Adapter saved to models/qwen-adapter/
```

## Local development

### Frontend

```bash
npm install
npm run dev          # http://localhost:3000
```

Create `.env.local`:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:8000
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend/
python -m venv .venv && source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env   # fill in DATABASE_URL + OPENAI_API_KEY
alembic upgrade head
uvicorn app.main:app --reload   # http://localhost:8000
```

### Run the pipeline manually

```bash
cd backend/

# All stages at once
python -m scripts.run_pipeline --triggered-by manual

# Or stage by stage
python -m scripts.ingest_full_articles --slug anthropic-newsroom --per-source-limit 5
python -m scripts.filter_articles
python -m scripts.score_articles
python -m scripts.cluster_articles
python -m scripts.summarize
python -m scripts.generate_draft
```

## Deployment

### Backend (Railway)

Deployed as two Railway services sharing one Postgres + Redis instance:

| Service | Config | Schedule |
|---------|--------|----------|
| `personal-ai-intelligence-tool` | `railway.toml` | Always-on API |
| `daily-pipeline-cron` | `railway.cron.toml` | 02:00 / 08:00 / 14:00 / 20:00 UTC |

On startup, `alembic upgrade head` runs in a background thread so Railway's healthcheck passes immediately.

Required environment variables:

| Variable | Purpose |
|----------|---------|
| `DATABASE_URL` | PostgreSQL connection string (`postgresql+psycopg://...`) |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | GPT-4o-mini calls for summarisation, translation, and draft generation |
| `REDIS_URL` | Auto-set by Railway Redis plugin |
| `APP_ENV` | `production` |
| `JWT_SECRET` | Signs admin JWT tokens |
| `ADMIN_USERNAME` / `ADMIN_PASSWORD` | Admin login credentials |

### Frontend (Vercel)

Auto-deploys from GitHub. Set one environment variable:

```
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=https://personal-ai-intelligence-tool-production.up.railway.app
```

## Design decisions worth noting

**Why not vector search for clustering?**
TF-IDF + cosine similarity runs locally with no API calls, adds zero cost per run, and works well on the short article excerpts we ingest. Vector embeddings would improve recall across semantically similar but lexically different articles — a natural next upgrade.

**Why GPT-4o-mini instead of a larger model?**
The pipeline runs 4x per day across 10+ sources. Filtering and scoring are handled by rule-based logic and a local ML model (zero API cost). GPT-4o-mini is only used for summarisation, translation, and draft generation — keeping total cost under $1/day.

**Why Redis cache with 5-min TTL?**
The digest and cluster list endpoints are hit on every page load. Caching avoids repeated Postgres aggregation queries. The pipeline explicitly busts the cache (`ai_tool:*`) after every successful run so stale data never persists beyond one cycle.
